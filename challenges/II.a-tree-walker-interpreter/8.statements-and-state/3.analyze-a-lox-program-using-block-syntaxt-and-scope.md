```lox
var a = 1;
{
  var a = a + 2;
  print a;
}
```
It should finally print 3 as result. The program first define an `a` variable in the global scope, then in the block scope define an `a` variable to shadow the global one and assign with the global `a` variable since the right association rule that `a` doesn't exit in block scope yet.

In Javascript, it can't access the variable in definition which has the same identify since Javascript create the variable first without initalizer and report an runtime error to block uninitialization variable access.
