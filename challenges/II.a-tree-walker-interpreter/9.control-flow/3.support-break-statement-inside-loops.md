In parser we maintain an `inLoop` boolean flag, once start a while/for statement we flag it as true and flip it at statement end. So when the `inLoop` flag is false we encounter a `break` statement we can easy throw a syntax error.

In interpreter we throw and customized exception when execute any break statement then catch it in loop execution that it can escape from looping.
