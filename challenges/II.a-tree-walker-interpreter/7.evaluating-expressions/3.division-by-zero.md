Jlox Return Infinity when divide a number by zero. I think it should report a runtime error. In Pyhton, Ruby and Java They also report a runtime error, but not Javascript.


> Because of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer programming languages (including those used by calculators) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a "Divide by zero" error. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero#Computer_arithmetic
